Spotify Tools is a web application that consumes the Spotify API to provide access to utilities that are not available on the official Spotify application. It is a built in React using the Material-UI framework and designed to be responsive.

<h3>Discover Weekly Extender</h3>
Discover Weekly playlists are nice, but you only get one 30 track playlist a week. This tools allows you to create a longer version of your discover weekly, using only songs that aren't already in your library.

<h3>Duplicate Pruner</h3>
The duplicate pruner removes duplicate tracks that tend to accumulate in your library over time. Because the exact same song can be released multiple times on different albums (say on a single release, then a full album), your may have saved multiple copies of the same song to your library. 

<h3>Running</h3>
This app was bootstrapped with create-react-app, so use the following commands to spool up a development build after cloning:

```npm install```
</br>
```npm start```
